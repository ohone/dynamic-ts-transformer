- extract comparer statement outside of for block
    - for (let i = 0; i < something.length; i++) // (`i < something.length` needs to be async)
    - const length = something.length // .. rest of for loop
- transform stuff inside string interpolation
- distinguish between method call and property access at compiled code - can't rely on disambiguation on the other createSandboxDynamicCodeServer
    - e.g. if (window.jQuery && window.jQuery.ui)
        - window.jQuery is a function - the above is testing for presence - we don't want to call the function
        - calling the function causes the subsequent `.ui` call to fail
- type annotations on function args prevent proxy checks 
    `async function something(history: string[]){ history[0] }`
    - history could be a proxy
